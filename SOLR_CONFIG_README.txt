The demo app schema.xml and solrconfig.xml files can be found at

/jetty/solr/conf

The demo app's SOLR instance (and the config files that go with it) are very
basic, and can be considered starting points.  The stanford examples given
here are more involved, and may not be relevant -- they are again provided as
examples.
